Description: The rDVR package allows you to start stop and save a video server
    from within R. It does this by way of a REST interface to a JAVA service.
    The jar binary relies on the screen recorder included in the Monte Media
    Library (CC BY 3.0 licence) developed by Werner Randelshofer
    (http://http://www.randelshofer.ch/monte/). The REST interface was modified
    from https://github.com/tuenti/VideoRecorderService which has an Apache
    licence.
